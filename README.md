The vorto web app allows you to create **a digital stack of vocabulary learning cards**. Expand your vocabulary for any foreign language with those words which are relevant for you.

- Create vocabulary cards including images and audio files
- Manage your vocabulary learning progress by moving those words that you have successfully learned to a separate stack
- Search for vocabulary
- Set up collections to group vocabs based on topic areas

I developed the app as my final project during the [neuefische coding bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/) beginning of 2020 in Hamburg, Germany.
