The vorto app allows you to create **a digital stack of vocabulary learning cards**. Expand your vocabulary for any foreign language with those words which are relevant for you.

- Set up vocabulary cards including images and audio files
- Manage your vocabulary learning progress by moving those words that you have successfully learned to a separate stack
- Search for vocabulary
- Set up a separate space for every language you are learning

For more information have a look at the [live demo](https://neuefische-vorto.web.app/).

I created the app as my capstone project at the [neuefische coding bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/).

## Usage

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Run the app:

`npm run client`
